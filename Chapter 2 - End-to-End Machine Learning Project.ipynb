    "### Prepare the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work on copies of the data\n",
    "* Write functions for all data transofrmations you apply, for five reasons:\n",
    "    - So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset\n",
    "    - So you can apply these transformations in future projects\n",
    "    - To clean and prepare the test set\n",
    "    - To clean and prepare a new data instances once your solution is live\n",
    "    - To make it easy to treat your prepatation choices as hyperparameters\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Data cleaning:\n",
    "    * Fix or remove outliers\n",
    "    * Fill in missing values or drop their rows or columns\n",
    "2. Feature selection: \n",
    "    * Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.\n",
    "3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:\n",
    "    * Discretize continuous features\n",
    "    * Decompose features\n",
    "    * Add promising transformations of features (e.g., $ \\log(x), \\sqrt x, x^2, $ etc.)\n",
    "    * Aggregate features into promising new features\n",
    "4. Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-List Promising Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train many quick and dirty models from different categories using standard parameters. \n",
    "2. Measure and compare their perfomance.\n",
    "3. Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.\n",
    "4. Analyze the types of errors the models make.\n",
    "5. Have a quick round of feature selection and engineering.\n",
    "6. Have one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.\n",
    "7. Short-list the top three to five most promising models, preferring models that make different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tune the System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation.\n",
    "2. Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will ofter perform better than running them individually. \n",
    "3. Once you are confident about your final model, measure its perfomance on the test set to estimate the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Present Your Solution \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document what you have done.\n",
    "2. Create a nice presentation. (Make sure you highlight the big picture first)\n",
    "3. Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.\n",
    "4. Don't forget to present interesting points you noticed along the way.\n",
    "    * Describe what worked and what did not.\n",
    "    * List your assumptions and your system's limitations.\n",
    "5. Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations or easy-to-remember statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs, write unit tests, etc.)|\n",
    "2. Write monitoring code to check your system's live perfomance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.\n",
    "    * Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to \"rot\" as data evolves\n",
    "    * Measuring perfomance may require a human pipeline\n",
    "    * Also monitor your inputs quality\n",
    "3. Retrain your model on a regilar basis on fresh data.\n",

    "A sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical perfomance measure for regression problems is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It measures the standard deviation of the errors the system makes in its prodictions. For example, an RMSE equal to 50,000 means that about 65% of the system's predictions fall within \\$50,000 of the actual value, and about 95% of the predictions fall within $100,000 of the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ RMSE(X, h) = \\sqrt {\\frac {1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m $ is a number of instances in th dataset you are measuring the RMSE on.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x^{(i)} $ is a vector of all the feature values of the $ i^{th} $ instance in the dataset, and $ y^{(i)} $ is its label.\n",
    "\n",
    "__X__ is a matrix containing all the feature values of all instances (excluding labels) in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ h $ is your system's prediction function, also called a hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE(X, h) is the cost function measured on the set of examples using your hypothesis h. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (Average Deviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$ MAE(X, h) = \\frac {1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} |h(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}| $\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the RMSE and the MAE are ways to measure the distance between two vectors: the vector of predictions and the vector of target values. RMSE is more sensetive to outliers than the MAE. But when outliers are exponentially rare, the RMSE performs very well and is generally preferred. "
