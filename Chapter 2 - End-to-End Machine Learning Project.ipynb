    "\n",
    "AUTOMATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List the data you need and how much you need.\n",
    "2. Find and document where you can get that data.\n",

    "9. Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected.\n",
    "10. Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical).\n",
    "11. Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a copy of the data for exploration.\n",
    "2. Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record of your data exploration.\n",
    "3. Study each attribute and its characteristics:\n",
    "    * Name\n",
    "    * Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)\n",
    "    * % of missing values\n",
    "    * Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)\n",
    "    * Possibly userful for the task?\n",
    "    * Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)\n",
    "4. For supervised learning tasks, identify the target attributes.\n",
    "5. Visualize the data.\n",
    "6. Study the correlations between attributes.\n",
    "7. Study how you would solve the problem manually. \n",
    "8. Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply. \n",
    "9. Identify extra data that would be useful.\n",
    "10. Document what you have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work on copies of the data\n",
    "* Write functions for all data transofrmations you apply, for five reasons:\n",
    "    - So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset\n",
    "    - So you can apply these transformations in future projects\n",
    "    - To clean and prepare the test set\n",
    "    - To clean and prepare a new data instances once your solution is live\n",
    "    - To make it easy to treat your prepatation choices as hyperparameters\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Data cleaning:\n",
    "    * Fix or remove outliers\n",
    "    * Fill in missing values or drop their rows or columns\n",
    "2. Feature selection: \n",
    "    * Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.\n",
    "3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:\n",
    "    * Discretize continuous features\n",
    "    * Decompose features\n",
    "    * Add promising transformations of features (e.g., $ \\log(x), \\sqrt x, x^2, $ etc.)\n",
    "    * Aggregate features into promising new features\n",
    "4. Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-List Promising Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train many quick and dirty models from different categories using standard parameters. \n",
    "2. Measure and compare their perfomance.\n",
    "3. Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.\n",
    "4. Analyze the types of errors the models make.\n",
    "5. Have a quick round of feature selection and engineering.\n",
    "6. Have one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.\n",
    "7. Short-list the top three to five most promising models, preferring models that make different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tune the System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation.\n",
    "2. Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will ofter perform better than running them individually. \n",
    "3. Once you are confident about your final model, measure its perfomance on the test set to estimate the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Present Your Solution \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document what you have done.\n",
    "2. Create a nice presentation. (Make sure you highlight the big picture first)\n",
    "3. Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.\n",
    "4. Don't forget to present interesting points you noticed along the way.\n",
    "    * Describe what worked and what did not.\n",
    "    * List your assumptions and your system's limitations.\n",
    "5. Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations or easy-to-remember statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs, write unit tests, etc.)|\n",
    "2. Write monitoring code to check your system's live perfomance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.\n",
    "    * Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to \"rot\" as data evolves\n",
    "    * Measuring perfomance may require a human pipeline\n",
    "    * Also monitor your inputs quality\n",
    "3. Retrain your model on a regilar basis on fresh data.\n",
